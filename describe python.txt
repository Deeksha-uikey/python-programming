1) What is Python Programming Language and explain the features of Python Programming Language.

answer -- 
       > Python is an object-oriented, high-level, interpreted programming language 
          known for its simplicity and its readability.

       > python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, 
         object-oriented, and functional programming.

       > It's widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, 
         scientific computing and more.


FEATURES OF PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE ARE:

> readable and maintainable code ~ python is clean and easy-to-read syntax
  that helps developers to write understandable and maintainable code.

> Interpreted Language ~ python is an interpreted language, meaning the code 
  is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier. 

> Dynamically Typed ~ variables in python do not explicit declaration to reserve 
  memory space. the declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

> High-Level Language ~ python abstracts many complex details of the computer from the 
  programmer, enabling the focus to be on programming rather than managing memory or the other low-level language.

> Portability ~ python code can run on various operating systems without modifications.

> Supports for multiple programming paradigms ~ python supports different programming 
  approaches, such as procedural programming or functional programming.
